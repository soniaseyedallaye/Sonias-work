    "Thinking in high dimensions is particularly hard. A 1-D dot would hardly be able to imagine a 2D world. In the same way, the square below struggles to think of our 3D world. For us, it is very difficult to imagine dimensions above the 3rd. We have proxies for thinking of a 4th dimension - passing of time, a 3D surface with some extra measure represented by color, etc - but this starts to become really difficult to work above the 4th dimension.  \n",

    "![dimensionality](./media/flatland.png)\n",

    "Thankfully, when dealing with ML problems, you can go above three features without trying to imagine how they would look like (Lucky you!). However, you still need to understand how the number of dimensions might affect - either positively or negatively - your models and how to work with high dimensional spaces. Don't worry, we will guide you through it."

    "So far you learned how to handle text data by transforming it into a vectorized feature space. Namely, we mostly used preprocessing tricks and some sort of count over words - remember the CountVectorizer and TF-IDF - to generate our feature space. However, as you might have realized, the number of features for these problems is huge, in particular if you want to cover all language. In the limit, your feature space will cover the entire vocabulary!\n",

    "Basic feature selection methods might actually work sometimes, in particular if you pick a reasonable heuristic to decide on which features to choose. In our case, obviously, just picking the higher counts is not that good, since it does not provide any useful information on the labels. But you could imagine for example trying to pick as features words that appear only (or almost only) on one of our classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although this might seem a good idea, depending on your problem, you would probably not want to lose that much time thinking about heuristics, implementing them and comparing them. This is where statistical tests are useful. You don't have to reason on the features you are using, these tests use your data to provide insights on your features.\n",

    "The chi-squared test is one of these tests. The chi-squared formula measures how much expected counts and observed counts of variables/distributions deviate from each other. It can be used to test for independce between two variables, like defined by the equation below, where $O_{x_1x_2}$ is the observation of the conjuction of variables and $E_{x_1x_2}$ the corresponding expected value, this is, the expected value given our hypothesis *$H_0$: the variables are independent*.\n",

    "For feature selection we want to test the independence of our features from the class labels. In our particular case, we define $x_1=t$ as our term or word and $x_2=c$ as our class label. A small chi-squared value will mean that the term is closer to independence from the class, and a big value that it is very dependent on the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing the details of the chi-squared can be useful for you, but in the context of our BLU is not our primary goal and there are more useful methods for text features that you will learn about in the following notebooks. However, we provide at the end of this BLU a more detailed explanation of this test, and some examples, if you wish to understand it better (see Annex A).\n",
