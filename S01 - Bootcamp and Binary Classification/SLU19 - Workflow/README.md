# Small Learning Unit 19 - Workflow

[Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Jr4fMzbqocphUHnKkz-uuul-yUwQxeSI570twWuhm30/edit?usp=sharing)

This is a learning unit that is mostly just a presentation of best practices and workflow steps. It is meant
to act more as a reference than as something that teaches technical tools. 

While the Learning notebook follows the curriculum, the Examples notebook deviates from most of the other
LUs in that it actually introduces a good number of new concepts that don't really have much to do with
Data Science directly but rather programming practices that, should you master, will allow you to spend
more time doing DS and less time being frustrated and debugging code.

## New concepts in this unit

- Workflow
- Workflow Tips
- Pipelines and custom estimators
- Notebook best practices (Examples notebook)

## New tools in this unit

- [sklearn Pipelines](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline.html)
